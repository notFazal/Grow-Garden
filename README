# The README includes a description of the application, what it does, and its main features.
This application aims to reduce user's not focusing on what is important. Their garden grows as long as they are on the website and not being distracted on something else. To ensure unique garden names a Bloom Filter is used. For quick and efficient lookup of other users a Trie is used.

# The README contains screenshots, GIFs, or videos of the landing page and at least one main feature to visually represent the application.
After backend and frontend setup, navigate to the link provided by the frontend.
### Sign in
* Use your login info to retrieve your garden or create a new account.

# The README explains why the application was built and clearly identifies the problem it is intended to solve.
Focus Garden was built to address the common issue of digital distraction and excessive screen time. Many people struggle to stay focused on important tasks when using digital devices, often getting sidetracked by unrelated apps or websites. This project provides a visual, rewarding way to encourage better focus habits by allowing users to see their efforts materialize through the growth of a virtual garden. The idea is to positively reinforce focus time instead of punishing distractions, making healthier digital habits more motivating and enjoyable.

# The README lists the React libraries and frameworks used in the project and justifies the selection of the backend (e.g., Flask vs. Django) in relation to the project's scope.
React.js – Chosen for its component-based structure and  fast updates with virtual DOM for building a dynamic, interactive UI.
Vite – Used for faster React app setup and development compared to traditional Create-React-App.
React Router – Used to manage navigation between different pages like Login, Signup, and Main Garden View.
Backend Framework:
Flask – Selected because it is lightweight, easy to set up, and perfectly suited for smaller full-stack applications like this one.
Firebase – Used for authentication and real-time database storage, simplifying user data management without having to manually build complex database servers.

# The README provides clear instructions to run the application locally, including all required commands for both frontend and backend. It also includes the package.json and requirements.txt files for the frontend and backend folders with the necessary packages to run the project.

This document assumes you have some version of python3, node (npm) installed on your local computer.

### a. Set up Backend
* Move into the backend directory -  ` cd backend `
* Create a new virtual environment - ` python3 -m venv .venv `
* Activate the virtual environment
  * For Windows : ` .\.venv\Scripts\activate `
  * For Mac : ` source .venv/bin/activate `
* You will now see a (.venv) infront of your command line
* To install all dependencies and packages, run ` pip3 install -r requirements.txt `
* Run the flask backend in debug mode for automatic reloading : ` flask --app app.py --debug run `
*  Your flask server will now be running on ` localhost:PORT `! You can look at the terminal for the port number

### b. Set up Frontend
* Move into the frontend directory - ` cd frontend `
* Install all packages by running ` npm install `
* To run the react frontend - ` npm run dev `
* Your react app is now running on ` localhost:PORT `! You can follow the link from the terminal for the port number.
* **Note** If failed to run due to incompatible node_modules or package-lock.json, run ` rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json `, and reinstall the packages
